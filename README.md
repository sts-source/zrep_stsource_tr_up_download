# ABAP Report for download/upload transport request from/to a server

## Foreword
\
Based on articles such as [here](https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blogs-by-members/how-to-download-upload-transport-request-from-to-a-server/ba-p/13271226), [here](https://community.sap.com/t5/devops-and-system-administration-blogs/upload-a-sap-transport-request-made-easy/ba-p/13405416) or [here](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-members/upload-transport-files-from-sap/ba-p/13580710), I would like to provide you with a report with which you can export and import transport requests from/to an SAP system.\
Unfortunately, the transactions mentioned in the linked articles (CG3Y, CG3Z) are not available in every SAP system. The same applies to the FuMo ARCHIVFILE_CLIENT_TO_SERVER.\
For example, these transactions are not available on an SAP DevSystem NPL (see here: [SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP Developer Edition 7.52 SP04](https://developers.sap.com/trials-downloads.html?search=abap)).
\
The report is a stand-alone application and uses as few dependencies as possible.\
